# Ethical Issues & Mitigation Strategy
## Our Approach
As a team, The Gurkhas believe that building a platform for students comes with a heavy responsibility. We aren't just building an app; we are creating a space where people meet and share knowledge. During our initial meetings, we identified three main areas where things could go wrong and developed a plan to handle them.

**1. Keeping it Academic (Not Cheating)**

The biggest risk for a "Skill-Swap" app like Uni-Bridge is that it becomes a shortcut for students to copy each other's work. We want to encourage collaboration, not collusion.

- **The Plan:** We will build a "Code of Honor" into the sign-up process. Users have to explicitly agree that they won't swap finished assignments or exam answers.

- **The Reality:** We can't watch every conversation, so we will include a "Report" button. If someone asks for a finished essay, the other student can flag it. We want Uni-Bridge to be a place for learning, not just passing.

**2. Physical Safety (The "Stranger Danger" Factor)**

Since the app encourages students to meet up in person, we have to think about their safety. We don't want students meeting in private rooms or off-campus late at night.

- **The Plan:** The app won't just say "go meet." It will actively suggest Safe Zones—specific spots like the University Library cafe or the Student Union.

- **The Logic:** By restricting registration to university-verified emails, we ensure that everyone on the platform is an actual student, which adds a massive layer of security compared to meeting someone on a random social media app.

**3. Privacy and Data (Respecting GDPR)**

We know how annoying it is to give away too much data. We decided as a team to only collect the bare essentials.

- **Our Rules:** We only need your name, your student ID (to prove you're real), and the modules you're good at.

- **Security:** We are using Docker to keep our database isolated during development. This means our user data isn't just sitting out in the open; it's tucked away in a secure, containerized environment that Roman has set up.

**4. Being Inclusive**

We specifically talked about international students who might feel isolated. We want Uni-Bridge to be a tool for them to make friends while they study. Our persona, Lucky, represents this—he’s great at coding but struggles with English. By letting him swap his coding skills for a "Library Buddy," we make the campus a friendlier place for everyone.
