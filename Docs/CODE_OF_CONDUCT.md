## Uni-Bridge Team (The Gurkhas) Code of Conduct – Agreed 6th February 2026
1.	**Communication:** All team members agree to use WhatsApp as the primary communication channel and respond to urgent messages within 24 hours.
2. 	**Meetings:**  We will meet weekly during lab sessions. If a member cannot attend, they must notify the Facilitator at least 4 hours in advance.
3.	**Conflict Resolution:** If a disagreement occurs (e.g., regarding project features), the team will hold a majority vote. If a tie occurs, the Facilitator (Sujita) has the deciding vote.
4.	**Work Distribution:** Every member is responsible for their assigned task. If someone is struggling, they must ask for help early so the Product Owner (Smarika) can adjust the Kanban board.
5.	**GitHub Etiquette:** No one shall "Force Push" to the main branch. All code must be tested locally using Roman's Docker setup before being committed.


**All team members agree to follow these guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and successful project delivery.**
